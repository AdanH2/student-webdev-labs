## Reflection Document

### HTML

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. The exercises in this section were great to get the hang of writing HTML code and getting
    familiar with the semantic elements of HTML. The one exercise that was particularly helpful was
    exercise 4 - form. I think forms are used everywhere and it was great to be able to learn
    how to create one using different types of inputs.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. All the exercises for this week were all great and I can't think of other exercises that would have
    helped me learn this week's topic better.

### Accessibility

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. This week there was only lab. However, with that being said, I thought it was a great exercise.
    I think that the exercise was a great way to learn how to use the Wave tool to detect
    accessibility issues. Since this week we learned about how important it is to keep accessibility in
    mind when creating UI's, this tool provides a powerful and convenient way to ensure that we are
    adhering to accessibility standards.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. I think that this exercise was very impactful in bettering my understanding with accessibility standards
    and my familiarity with Wave. This exercise completed its goal and I don't think another exercise was
    necessary.

### CSS

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own except for exercise 1. I had trouble with getting the colors to
    match with the screenshots provided. I had to reference the solution for that, however that was it. I was able to produce the actual code for the this and all subsequent exercises.
2. I think that all these exercises this week were very helpful in learning the basics of CSS and getting
    familiar with using attribute, descendant, child, sibling, and pseudo selectors to achieve the customization we want. I think exercise 6 was particularly helpful, because it is important to keep screen sizes in mind when creating UIs and this exercise was perfect for learning how to do so. The one exercise that seemed a bit like busy work was exercise 3. Maybe I just don't fully understand the importance of specificity, but the exercise didn't really help me understand CSS any more than I already did with the rest of the exercises.
3. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was specificity and its importance or lack 
    thereof.
4. The exercises this week were more than enough to get the hang of CSS.

### Flex Box

1. I was not able to complete the lab by myself. I was able to complete all but one of the containers in 
    exercise 1 by myself which was container 3. I was able to get the items to appear in the column reverse 
    fashion, however, I got stuck on how to get them on to the right side of the page. I tried things like 
    `align-items: end;` and `justify-content: right;` but forgot about `align-items: flex-end;`.
2. The exercise this week was a great way to learn about flex box and how useful it can be to arrange items
    within a container. I think container 5 could have possibly been left out as I don't think this 
    strengthened my understanding of flex box all that much, other than knowing I can assign different 
    heights to the items within a container.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. There aren't any other exercises that I can think of that could have helped my understanding more. As 
    mentioned previously, exercise 1 could have been just as effective with maybe one less container.
