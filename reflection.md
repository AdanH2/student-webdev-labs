## Reflection Document

### HTML

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. The exercises in this section were great to get the hang of writing HTML code and getting
   familiar with the semantic elements of HTML. The one exercise that was particularly helpful was
   exercise 4 - form. I think forms are used everywhere and it was great to be able to learn
   how to create one using different types of inputs.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. All the exercises for this week were all great and I can't think of other exercises that would have
   helped me learn this week's topic better.

### Accessibility

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. This week there was only lab. However, with that being said, I thought it was a great exercise.
   I think that the exercise was a great way to learn how to use the Wave tool to detect
   accessibility issues. Since this week we learned about how important it is to keep accessibility in
   mind when creating UI's, this tool provides a powerful and convenient way to ensure that we are
   adhering to accessibility standards.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. I think that this exercise was very impactful in bettering my understanding with accessibility standards
   and my familiarity with Wave. This exercise completed its goal and I don't think another exercise was
   necessary.

### CSS

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own except for exercise 1. I had trouble with getting the colors to
   match with the screenshots provided. I had to reference the solution for that, however that was it. I was able to produce the actual code for the this and all subsequent exercises.
2. I think that all these exercises this week were very helpful in learning the basics of CSS and getting
   familiar with using attribute, descendant, child, sibling, and pseudo selectors to achieve the customization we want. I think exercise 6 was particularly helpful, because it is important to keep screen sizes in mind when creating UIs and this exercise was perfect for learning how to do so. The one exercise that seemed a bit like busy work was exercise 3. Maybe I just don't fully understand the importance of specificity, but the exercise didn't really help me understand CSS any more than I already did with the rest of the exercises.
3. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was specificity and its importance or lack
   thereof.
4. The exercises this week were more than enough to get the hang of CSS.

### Flex Box

1. I was not able to complete the lab by myself. I was able to complete all but one of the containers in
   exercise 1 by myself which was container 3. I was able to get the items to appear in the column reverse
   fashion, however, I got stuck on how to get them on to the right side of the page. I tried things like
   `align-items: end;` and `justify-content: right;` but forgot about `align-items: flex-end;`.
2. The exercise this week was a great way to learn about flex box and how useful it can be to arrange items
   within a container. I think container 5 could have possibly been left out as I don't think this
   strengthened my understanding of flex box all that much, other than knowing I can assign different
   heights to the items within a container.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better.
4. There aren't any other exercises that I can think of that could have helped my understanding more. As
   mentioned previously, exercise 1 could have been just as effective with maybe one less container.

### CSS Grid

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own, however there were a couple of times that I referenced the
   slides.
2. I think that both exercises in this lab were very helpful. However, I would have to say that exercise 2
   in my opinion was a bit more helpful. I find that grid areas might have a bit more of usefulness in
   practice.
3. There was nothing that I wish was explained better. The slides and lecture were very helpful in
   completing the lab.
4. I think both exercises were very helpful in learning this week's material. I can't imagine another
   exercise helping in learning the material.

### Bootstrap

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. I think that all the exercises in this week's lab were equally very helpful. My favorite one in
   particular was the cards exercise. I think there are many use cases for this component in the
   real world. As a matter of fact, I used boostrap cards in an assignment for another class actually.
3. I can not think of anything else that could have been explained better. I think learning Boostrap
   is a ton of hands on practice as well as going through their documentation. You did a great job
   of explaining as much as you could in class.
4. I think an exercise on Bootstrap forms could have been helpful, however the homework contained
   a part of implementing a form using Bootstrap.

### Javascript

1. I was able to complete the lab on my own.
2. The exercises in this section were all helpful, some moreso than others. When thinking about using
   concepts from the exercises in industry, I can definitely see using the conepts from the exercises 4 and
   6 the most however I understand the usefulness of the exercises for getting familiar with javascript.
3. The concepts in this section were all taught and explained well. I am fairly familiar with Javascript
   however, so I understood what was taught as it was more refresher information.
4. The exercises in this section were plenty enough to help learn this week's topics very well.
